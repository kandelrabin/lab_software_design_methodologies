# Legal and Ethical Standards


## Scenario 1: BankingCorp and Payday Loan Company


### Legal concerns

- **Data privacy and protection**: 
	- **Data sharing**: Sharing of customer data to the payday loan company without customer consent violates GDPR law. Articles 13 and 14 of the UK GDPR specifies privacy information that must be provided to individuals. This includes the purpose of data sharing and processing, receipents of data and retention period. The information provided to individuals must be concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible and use clear and plain language. However, by only sending updated terms and conditions Banking corp have misled the customers by making this information difficult to access. 
	- **Data processing**: Allowing payday loan company to use algorithm to process customer's personal data to identify financially struggling customers again violates GDPR. GDPR in this case is violated due to automated individual decision making, and profiling. 

- **Consumer protection law**:
	- **Misleading practices**: The lack of transparency around the partnership and the negative publicity surrounding the payday loan company are violations of the customer protection regulations.


### Ethical concerns

- **Exploitation of struggling customers**:
	- **Targeting**: It may be viewed as exploitation of customers' financial vulnerabilities to use their financial data to target them with high-interest loans when they are struggling financially.
	- **Lack of transparency**: It could be seen as dishonest to customers to not tell them about the partnership in public and hide the information in the terms and conditions.
-  **Trust and integrity**: Banks are trusted by customers with their private financial information. This trust may be seriously harmed by disclosing this information to a payday loan company with negative publicity.


### Recommendations
- **Explicit consent**: Make sure that any data sharing with any existing and new third-party company depends on the consumers' clear and informed consent.

- **Transparent communication**: Describe the nature of the third-party collaboration and usage of client data in a clear and plain language.

- **Focus on customer wellbeing**: Instead of participating in predatory behaviour, banks, as stewards of their customers' financial information, need to offer useful services including budget notifications, saving goals, assisting clients in identifying unhealthy spending patterns, and producing expenditure reports.

- **Review and monitor third-party partners**: Regularly evaluate and audit third-party agreements to ensure compliance with moral and legal standards.
