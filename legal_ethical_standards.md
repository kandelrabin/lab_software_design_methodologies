# Legal and Ethical Standards
<br>

## Scenario 1: BankingCorp and Payday Loan Company


### Legal concerns

- **Data privacy and protection** 
	- **Data sharing**: Sharing of customer data to the payday loan company without customer consent violates GDPR law. Articles 13 and 14 of the UK GDPR specifies privacy information that must be provided to individuals. This includes the purpose of data sharing and processing, receipents of data and retention period to name a few. The information provided to individuals must be concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible and use clear and plain language. However, by only sending updated terms and conditions Banking corp have misled the customers by making this information difficult to access. 
	- **Data processing**: Allowing payday loan company to use algorithm to process customer's personal data to identify financially struggling customers again violates GDPR. GDPR in this case is violated due to automated individual decision making, and profiling. 

- **Consumer protection law**:
The lack of transparency around the partnership and the negative publicity surrounding the payday loan company are violations of the customer protection regulations.


### Ethical concerns

- **Exploitation of struggling customers**
	- **Targeting**: It may be viewed as exploitation of customers' financial vulnerabilities to use their financial data to target them with high-interest loans when they are struggling financially.
	- **Lack of transparency**: It could be seen as dishonest to customers to not tell them about the partnership in public and hide the information in the terms and conditions.
-  **Trust and integrity**: Banks are trusted by customers with their private financial information. This trust may be seriously harmed by disclosing this information to a payday loan company with negative publicity.


### Recommendations
- **Explicit consent**: Make sure that any data sharing with any existing and new third-party company depends on the consumers' clear and informed consent.
- **Transparent communication**: Describe the nature of the third-party collaboration and usage of client data in a clear and plain language.
- **Focus on customer wellbeing**: Instead of participating in predatory behaviour, banks, as stewards of their customers' financial information, need to offer useful services including budget notifications, saving goals, assisting clients in identifying unhealthy spending patterns, and producing expenditure reports.
- **Review and monitor third-party partners**: Regularly evaluate and audit third-party agreements to ensure compliance with moral and legal standards.

## Scenario 2: Monetisation of Treasure Hunters

### Legal concerns
- **Consumer protection law**
	- **Transparency**: To guarantee that players are aware of what they are buying and the associated prices, it is necessary to communicate clearly when real money is used for hints and when multi-buy discounts are offered. This is important step to prevent misleading practices.
	- **In-app purchases for children**: In-app purchases raise extra legal problems if the game is accessible to children. These legal considerations include the need for parental agreement and adherence to child protection standards.
- **Gambling regulation**: If the game includes purchase and multi-buy discounts of any kind that contains element of randomness, for example purchasing a ticket for spinning wheel that gives a bonus or mystery object, may be investigated under gambling laws.

### Ethical concerns
- **Exploitation of players**
	- **Addictive design**: It can become addictive when in-game rewards are acquired using real-world money, especially if the purpose of the game is to encourage frequent spending. By providing incentives and drawing players in with features like alerts to play when a new map is launched, the game may become addictive.
	- **Fairness**: Players who are unable to purchase hints may feel disadvantaged, resulting in a pay-to-win mentality that might limit satisfaction for non-paying players.

- **Transparency and consent**: Players should be completely aware of the nature of in-app purchases, the benefits of purchasing hints, and the potential costs associated. In the case of young children clear terms of engagement and parental supervision is required.


### Recommendations
- **Clear information**: Provide clear and open information regarding the cost of hints, what they provide, and how they affect gameplay. Make sure this information is clearly available before making any purchases.
- **Parental controls**: Implement effective parental controls to regulate and prohibit minors' in-app purchases.
- **Fair game design**: Ensure that the game is pleasant and fair to all players, regardless of whether they make in-app payments. Avoid creating scenarios in which gamers feel obligated to spend money to advance.
- **Mitigate Addiction**: Monitor and minimise addictive behaviours by imposing realistic time limitations on gameplay and in-app purchases, as well as giving tools for players to control their spending.

## Scenario 3: Premium Membership and Targeted Advertising on friends.com


### Legal concerns
- **Data protection and privacy**
	- **GDPR compliance**: It requires consumers' explicit permission to share location data for targeted advertising. Legal repercussions can be avoided by adhering to GDPR and other data protection rules.
	- **Transparency**: Users should be made fully aware of the types of data being gathered, how they will be used, and who they will be shared with. Clearly explain privacy policies and get express agreement before sharing data.

- **Consumer rights**: The technique of replacing generic advertisements with customised ads based on user data must be carefully explained to users so that they understand how their information is utilised to generate income.

### Ethical concerns
- **User autonomy and informed consent**
	- **Consent for data use**: Complete control over user data should be granted, including the choice to accept or reject targeted advertising. To preserve user trust, informed permission is essential.
	- **Transparency in pricing**: Clearly describe the benefits of premium membership and make sure consumers understand which functions will be restricted behind the paywall.

- **Privacy and data security**:
	- **Protecting user data**: Ensure that sensitive user data, such as location data, is securely stored and protected from unauthorized access. Data breaches could jeopardise user trust and safety.
	- **Responsible advertising**: Use targeted advertising responsibly, making sure the advertisements are relevant and not invasive. Avoid using too pushy or deceptive advertising methods.


### Recommendations
- **Explicit consent**: Obtain users' unambiguous, explicit agreement to the usage of their location data for targeted advertising. Provide simple ways for people to manage their consent preferences.
- **Transparent privacy policies**: Clearly define how user data will be used, shared, and secured. Make privacy policies clearly accessible and understood.
- **Cost-value justification**: Ensure that the premium membership provides obvious, meaningful advantages that are worth the fee. Avoid developing an overly restricted free tier that feels useless unless upgraded.
- **Trial period ethics**: Use trial periods responsibly, highlighting the benefits of the premium service without using deceitful approaches to get people to subscribe.
